# 🌌 Metanoia — Experimental Website  

This is an **early experimental website** for the Metanoia app.  
It’s not the final product — just a working concept to show how the app might look, feel, and explain our mission + impact.

## 🚀 What’s Inside
- ✨ A **hero section** with our tagline: *Swipe. Match. Get Shortlisted.*  
- 🧩 Feature cards like Smart Matching, Referrals, Automated Scheduling, Location-Smart, and Zizz Mode  
- 📅 A simple **4-step flow** showing how Metanoia works  
- 🔄 **Swipe navigation**:

## ⚡ Behind the Project
This experimental website was **designed and structured by me** — including the idea, features, site flow, hidden swipe navigation, and animations.  

Since I’m still learning to code, I used **AI coding tools** to help generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The creative direction, product thinking, and design decisions are mine.  

The focus here is on **turning an idea into something real and testable**, while I continue building my coding skills step by step.
