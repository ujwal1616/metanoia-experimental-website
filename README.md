# 🌌 Metanoia — Experimental Website  

This is an **early experimental website** for the Metanoia app.  
It’s not the final product — just a working concept to show how the app might look, feel, and explain our mission + impact.

- 🧩 Feature cards like Smart Matching, Referrals, Automated Scheduling, Location-Smart, and Zizz Mode
