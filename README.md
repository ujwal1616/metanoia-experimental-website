# 🌌 Metanoia — Experimental Website  

This is an **early experimental website** for the Metanoia app.  
It’s not the final product — just a working concept to show how the app might look, feel, and explain our mission + impact.  

---

##  What’s Inside
-  A **hero section** with our tagline: *Swipe. Match. Get Shortlisted.*  
-  Feature cards like Smart Matching, Referrals, Automated Scheduling, Location-Smart, and Zizz Mode  
-  A simple **4-step flow** showing how Metanoia works  
-  **Swipe navigation**:  
  - Swipe left once → Mission  
  - Swipe left twice → Impact  
  - Swipe right → Back to previous page  
  - Works with keyboard arrows too (← → Esc)  
-  Loading animation with glowing Metanoia text  
-  Responsive design + smooth transitions and animations

##  Mission
At **Metanoia**, we want to change how job seekers and recruiters connect.  
The goal is simple: make job search **less boring, more human, and actually exciting**.

## ⚡ Behind the Project
This experimental website was **designed and structured by me** — including the idea, features, site flow, hidden swipe navigation, and animations.  

Since I’m still learning to code, I used **AI coding tools** to help generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The creative direction, product thinking, and design decisions are mine.  

The focus here is on **turning an idea into something real and testable**, while I continue building my coding skills step by step.
